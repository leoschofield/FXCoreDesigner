If param going to acc32 tag it in comment with ;@pot to acc32@

Tags like $REG_temp$ must have a space before commas 

Parameter tags start at 1 and must be in the form $PAMAM1$ , $PARAM2$ exactly (parameter tags replaces pot registers eg "pot0_smth")

All register names should be renamed like temp -> $REG_temp$ do not add them to the directive as registers are handled automatically

Input to blocks are received from r0 outputs must be passed to r0, currently no support for stereo blocks

Names for .equ and .mems must wrapped with a pair of dollar signs e.g. shiftbase.u -> $shiftbase$.u

Names for goto labels must be wrapped in dollars OK: -> $OK$: 

refences to ramps lfos etc must be wrapped in dollars e.g. rmp0|l4096 -> $rmp$|l4096 ,  ramp0_f -> $ramp$_f

Dollar signs $ and at signs @ must only be used when tagging, and the correct rules must be followed when tagging
