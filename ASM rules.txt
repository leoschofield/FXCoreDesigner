If param going to acc32 tag it in comment with ;@pot to acc32@

Register tags like $REG_temp$ must have a space afterwards as the code needs to see the space character to work correctly

Parameter tags start at 1 and must be in the form $PAMAM1$ , $PARAM2$ exactly (parameter tags replaces pot registers eg "pot0_smth")

All register names should be renamed like temp -> $REG_temp$ do not add them to the directive as registers are handled automatically

r15 can be left alone

Input to blocks are received from r0 outputs must be passed to r0, currently no support for stereo blocks

Names .mems must wrapped with a pair of dollar signs e.g. delay -> $delay$

Names for .equs can be left alone

Names for goto labels must be wrapped in dollars OK: -> $OK$: 

refences to ramps lfos etc must be wrapped in dollars e.g. rmp0|l4096 -> $rmp$|l4096 ,  ramp0_f -> $ramp$_f

Dollar signs $ and at signs @ must only be used when tagging, and the correct rules must be followed when tagging

Remember to rename Instructions when replacing inputs and outputs eg. in0 -> r0 = cpy_cs -> cpy_cc

the first user output a block uses should be renamed $USER1$ and a second as $USER2$, e.g. user0|0, -> $USER1$|0, 

different blocks must not have a common name for an equ

code for user outputs should be preceded by a '; @USER START@' line and followed by a '; @USER END@' line
